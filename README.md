# stroke-prediction
This project centers around the prediction of the probability of suffering a stroke for an individual based on several characteristics, such as their gender, age, whether the person has hypertension or heart disease, average glucose level after a meal, body mass index (BMI), among others. The data set was extracted from Kaggle and consists of 12 variables for a total of 5,110 patients.

The report is organized as follows. Section I contains general information about the dataset and the research question. Section II includes steps taken to clean and/or transform the data set. Section III describes the initial variable selection methods for numerical and categorical predictors. Section IV and V deal with the identification of multicollinearity and interaction terms, respectively, for the logistic model to be constructed. Section VII contains the logistic regression model including final variable selection, model results, and classification report. Section VII concludes this report with a summary of the steps taken and any issues encountered in the previous sections.
